LEAFLENS is a deep learning-based project focused on classifying maize leaf diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to accurately identify common diseases like Blight, Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, and distinguish them from Healthy leaves. 

The project leverages transfer learning with pre-trained models like MobileNetV2, Xception, and DenseNet121, fine-tuned for optimal performance on a specialized maize leaf dataset.

The system not only identifies diseases with high accuracy but also provides visual and intuitive explanations using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), explaining why the model made a specific prediction, fostering trust and usability for end-users like farmers and agronomists.
